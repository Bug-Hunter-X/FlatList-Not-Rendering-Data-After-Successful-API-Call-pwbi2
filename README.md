# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call.  The app fetches data from a public API, but the FlatList remains blank even though the data is available. This issue is often caused by improper state management or asynchronous operation handling.

## Bug Description
The `DataFetch` component fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API.  The `ActivityIndicator` disappears, indicating the fetch is complete, however, the FlatList remains empty.  The console shows no errors.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the FlatList re-renders when the data updates. This often involves correctly using the `useEffect` hook and ensuring that the `data` state is correctly updated.
